**ENPH** and **RUN** emerged as the top performers in 2018, showcasing their resilience and ability to navigate the market successfully. ENPH attracted attention with an impressive return of 81.92% and a substantial volume of $607,473,500. Similarly, RUN demonstrated its potential with a remarkable return of 83.95% and a significant volume of $502,757,100. These stocks capitalized on emerging opportunities and delivered favorable returns to investors.

One interesting observation is the significant contrast in performance for **DQ** between 2017 and 2018. In 2017, DQ emerged as the top performer, achieving an exceptional return of 199.45% with a relatively lower volume of $35,796,200. This remarkable growth positioned DQ as an attractive investment option and garnered significant attention from investors.

However, the story took a different turn in 2018. Despite having a high volume of $107,873,900, DQ encountered substantial challenges, resulting in a significant decline in returns at -62.60%. This decline highlights the volatility of the market and serves as a reminder that past performance does not guarantee future success. The stark contrast between DQ's performance in the two years demonstrates the risks inherent in investing and the need for careful evaluation and monitoring of market conditions.
